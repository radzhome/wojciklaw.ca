            <p style="text-align: justify;">The duty to act in “good faith” in real estate contracts was dealt with in a recent
                Supreme Court ruling<b> <i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bhasin v. Hrynew</span></i></b><i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The
                Court’s decision<i> </i>re-wrote existing Canadian case law about the legal duties of contracting parties during
                the negotiations of the contract and after the contract has been signed. The Court ruled that during the
                negotiation process each party have a right to pursue his or her individual self-interest and does not require
                either party to consider the interests of the other party ahead of his or her own.&nbsp; However, after the
                contract has been signed, the parties to the contract must perform their obligations arising from the signed
                contract part in “good faith” in an honest manner throughout the course of a transaction.&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The parties must co-operate in order to achieve the objects of the contract. <b>The
                duty to act in “good faith” forces both parties to make a reasonable effort to satisfy their part of the
                bargain.</b> The parties have to act fairly, with diligence, care and duty of honest performance of their
                contractual obligation and they should refrain from evading their duties or “to act in a way that defeats the
                very purpose and objective of the agreement”.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>What does this mean to the buyer and seller and you as their agent?&nbsp; </b>
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">As an agent, you should always advance and protect your client’s interests. Always
                check and verify the information you receive from your client or the other party. Do not rely on the promises of
                the seller or buyer or the other party’s agent. Include in the Agreement of Purchase and Sale absolutely
                everything which is important to your client, and remember, that <b>if it is not in writing it is not
                    binding.</b></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>When acting for the buyer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></p>
            <ol style="text-align: justify;">
                <li>Include all relevant conditions to protect your client's interests with sufficient time allotted to fulfill
                    those conditions.
                </li>
                <li>Explain that the duty to act in “good faith” forces <b>buyer to take all necessary steps needed to close the
                    transaction,</b> therefore, the buyer must apply for financing, conduct the home inspection, arrange the
                    home insurance within time allotted to do so. In <b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rice v. Rawlik</span></i></b>
                    the Court concluded that buyer acted in “bad faith” when the buyer refused to close the transaction because
                    of several outstanding work orders. The buyer knew about the work orders but choose to raise the problem
                    just before closing so there was not sufficient time for the Seller to remediate them.
                </li>
                <li>Explain, that a <b>buyer would not be allowed to bring a contract to an end for an undisclosed reason or for
                    a condition not contained in the Agreement of Purchase and Sale, but are limited in their ability to
                    terminate the Agreement for actual conditions</b> such as obtaining financing in the buyer’s “sole and
                    absolute discretion”, inspection condition, insurance or lawyer’s approval of a condition, if buyer have a
                    sudden change of heart.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The buyer is allowed to terminate the Agreement <b><span
                    style="text-decoration: underline;">only </span></b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">in case that the condition can not be satisfied but not for any other reason</span>
                such as buyer’s remorse. If a buyer is concerned he may change his mind, or needs to sell his exiting property
                in order to have funds to buy the new property, the agent needs to insert the appropriate condition allowing the
                buyer to terminate the agreement for whatever reason in the buyer’s sole and absolute discretion, within a
                defined period of time after acceptance. However, keep in mind that most sellers would probably not accept such
                a condition. The buyer also cannot rely on a lawyer’s approval condition to terminate the contract unreasonably.
                Unless there is a legitimate legal reason to do so, the lawyer would not advise and suggest that the buyer
                should terminate the transaction.&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>When acting for the seller</b></p>
            <ol style="text-align: justify;">
                <li>Explain that <b>the sellers are not obliged to accept all the buyer’s conditions</b> and at least they
                    should try to negotiate to modify the restrictions or limitations. &nbsp;Specifically they should negotiate
                    those conditions that allow the buyer to terminate the contract in the buyer’s “sole and absolute
                    discretion”. For example, in the case of an inspection condition, you can insert into the Agreement a clause
                    that the buyer could not terminate the contract without disclosing the reason for the termination and allow
                    the seller to decide if he or she wants to remediate the problem by making the appropriate repairs or
                    upgrades. The other suggestion could be to allow the termination only if the costs of repairs exceed an
                    amount specified in the agreement. In case of a financing condition, &nbsp;the seller can insist on
                    replacing the buyer’s condition with one more specific by including in the contract the amount of principal
                    of the mortgage the buyer is seeking, the rate of interest and the term of the mortgage.
                </li>
                <li>Explain that <b>the sellers should not unreasonably interfere or hinder the buyer’s efforts in discharging
                    his or her obligations under the contract</b>, for example, to refuse access to the house or condominium for
                    inspection purposes or to let the lender’s appraiser to appraise the [property for financing purpose.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The bottom line:</b> Because of the duty to act in “good faith,” the party who
                has failed to use his or her reasonable efforts to fulfil his or her part of the contract, will not be permitted
                to rely on his failure to terminate the agreement.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Generally speaking, the parties to an agreement should not enter into a contract
                with little or no intention of performing. They should not act in a capricious or arbitrary manner and should
                take greater care in how they communicate with each other. Conduct such as lying or deceiving the other party
                can potentially give the injured party rise to claims for damages of negligent or fraudulent misrepresentation.
                In the event of a breach of the duty to act in good faith, the court may order an award against the seller of
                specific performance or damages resulting from their conduct, the buyers risk loosing their deposit and both
                parties may potentially suffer a lot of stress and costs in case of lengthy litigation.</p>
